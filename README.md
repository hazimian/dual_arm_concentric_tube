# Dual-Arm Concentric Tube Robot
This is the repo for the control system of a dual-arm concentric-tube robot developed at Center at Image-Guided Innovation and Therapeutic Innovation at Hospital for Sick Children. A short paper can be found here https://github.com/hazimian/dual_arm_concentric_tube/blob/main/dual-arm-hamlyn.pdf

Each arm has four joints with an additional end-effector joint.
The arms are teleoperated using two Omni haptic devices.
The actuators and sensors are interfaced to via a Quanser QPID board that using Quanser QUARC simulink link allows a real-time control of the arm through the simulink model.
